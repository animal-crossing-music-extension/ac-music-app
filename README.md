## Why a successor?

Since 2020, Google plans to sunset Manifest v2 extensions in favour of Manifest v3, this will make AC Music extension impossible to function as you cannot play audio in the background using Manifest v3 (probably among other things).

Additionally, the extension was removed from the Chrome Web Store in 2020 with seemingly no possibility to ever have it re-listed. While it is still possible to install the extension, it requires developer tools and it is not easy for most people to do so.

In 2023, Google did introduce a method to play audio in the background using Manifest v3, but due to the extension not being able to be listed, it's a bit pointless to rework it, so this successor was born.
